    <h3>My About Page</h3>
    
    <p>I’m a senior at the <em>University of Missouri</em> studying <strong>Information Technology and Business</strong>. In late December, I will be receiving my Bachelors of Science in <em>Information Technology</em> and a minor in <em>Business Administration.</em> <br> <blockquote>One of my favorite quotes/sayings is “I am better than no man and no man is better than me.” </blockquote> I’m not exactly sure who it’s by but it is something that I try to live by.</p>
