            <h2>Enjoy these paragraphs about my personal journey!</h2>

            <p class="firstp">Being in college has been a tough road. It’s nothing like high school. The course load is way harder and heavier, especially for me being an engineering major. However, I do appreciate the courses I’ve taken for challenging me academically. One of the good
                things about being challenged academically is that it has taught me what I did and didn’t enjoy learning. Some courses I didn’t want to take but others were enjoyable to be in.</p>
                
            <p class="indent">My course program has shown me that I am capable of more than I thought I was coming into college. Looking bad and realizing that I passed and fulfilled the
                requirements of an engineering degree program feels good. Now that I’m close to graduation, I can say that my course experience wasn’t as bad as I thought it was in the past.</p>
                
            <p class="indent">Even though I haven’t started my actual career, I feel like I have had a career with my extracurricular endeavors. Since I started college, I have been involved in
                extracurricular organizations. Organizations ranging from academic, social, leadership, mentorship, and community service. Each organization has added to my experience and college career in a positive way.</p> 
            
            <p class="indent">These experiences have taught many things that I wouldn’t have learned in my academic courses. For example, I learned how to get out of my comfort zone and
                become a great leader.. Other than experiences, I've gained skills, built relationships, and endured some of the toughest challenges. I don’t have any regrets for my college career but I do hope the career I walk into after I graduate college would be just as meaningful as this one.</p>
