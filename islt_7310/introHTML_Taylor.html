    Hey! My name is DeAndre Taylor and I am a senior from St. Louis, Missouri studying Information Technology with a minor in Business. I do have some previous web application and development experience. I have taken two classes and learned some things on my own a long time ago. Even though I have some experience, there is still a lot I need and want to learn about web dev. My expectations for this course is to expand my knowledge of web development and basically learn as much as I can. I want to achieve a better grasp on the concept of web applications and everything that entails. Specifically, I hope to learn html, css, and javascript to the point where I can teach others. My favorite hobby would probably be roller skating and whenever I have time going to the gym and playing the playstation is something that I like to do.
